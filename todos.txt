todos:
- when a user enters any command, make sure their nickname in the guild is readable aka "Gill H. or Gill" and NOT "diesWithoutGrace"
- lifetime miles (this is a grande task)
- make /newrun error handling more descriptive for the user if they do something wrong
- create /routes select list and delete the current commands for the routes
    - check date and make sure they are getting the correct map if it is daylight savings or not
    - create the actual routes in google maps and use the urls
- update /pushform to include better response to command sender
    - were bad times handled correctly?
    - what time was submitted to google if needed to be handled?
- update /newrun to check for id in static data
    - pull users sheet when heife signs in and set the static data users obj for quick check
- figure out a way to use a discord user id for the current sheet check, which is using first name last name
    - likely we will do key/val pairs in an obj for static data users and match the user id then retrieve the sheet
- assign roles when mileage tiers are hit
- create /myrewards for each user (grande)
    - we will need another sheet that tracks rewards according to what your total mileage is, and if you have cashed them in or not.
    - mia will need a command to mark off rewards so we don't have that responsibility anymore. takes weight off of tom and mia both
- optimize heife to pull all data from sheets on login and set as objects in static data? maybe a new file called current data or something for the sheet data that is pulled on login (very, very grande)
    - need a new token every 60 minutes for the google sheets
    - need a function to run every minute or so to check for local data changes, and push them to google sheets
- check untappd api to connect AC beers to a command /taplist or something fun that doesn't involve run data
- write a command that will ping everyone with pre-set templates for announcements so cliff only has to input /announcement **template number** on tuesdays to send an announcement out
- refactor /commands. the character limit per message is going to poop itself once we have too many commands
- setup server at home
- create command /previousrun or something for people that forgot to submit the previous week so in the event of a muliplier they don't sneak double miles. this will involve a date param
- /leaderboard command. need two: top and relative to the user who runs the command because of character limits. ask dibes about how he returns the cs teams as a photo on csccore
- add more content to static data new run responses and greetings. need more variation as i have seen many repeats one after another
- add any useful stuff to utility.js
- come up with more fun commands so we don't beat our heads against the wall only doing run stuff. gotta enjoy the little things
